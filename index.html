<h2>DUIFRFDS: Refresh DisplayStatus Change Method DUIFCRDC</h2>
This object-independent method can be run by any application to change the
 DisplayStatus field to the current DisplayStatus value for every real and aggregate
 resource defined in RODM.<br><br>
<b> Function: </b>This method is useful when the DisplayStatus mapping table,
 DUIFSMT, has been changed. Instead of waiting for a status change from the
 network to trigger an exception view update, method DUIFRFDS can be run to
 cause the status change, which recalculates the exception state of the objects. The
 appropriate exception views are then updated.<br>
<b>Input: </b>This method requires no input parameters and can be triggered with the
 following RODM load function primitive statement:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 See sample CNMSJH13 for an example of triggering the method.<br>

<h2>DUIFVCFT: Change Exception State</h2>
 This object-independent method can be run by a user method to change the
 exception state of an object.<br><br>
<b> Function: </b>The user method that runs method DUIFVCFT is specified by the
 USRXMETH keyword in DisplayStatus mapping table DUIFSMT. Sample user
 methods DUIFCUXM and DUIFCUX2 run method DUIFVCFT to set either value
 XCPT or NOXCPT in the ResourceTraits field the same way a real DisplayStatus
 change is processed. DUIFVCFT will then trigger a method to determine if the
 change in exception state will cause the object to be added to or deleted from any
 open exception views.<br>

 1 record to the RODM log. Table 204 on page 487 lists the reason codes that can be
 returned by this method.<br><br>
 <b> Notes:</b>
 1. Resource_Object_ID is the object id of the resource whose changed
 DisplayStatus triggered the user method.<br>
 2. Set Requested_exception_status to 0 if you do not want the resource to have an
 exception state. DUIFVCFT will set value NOXCPT in the ResourceTraits field
 for this resource.<br>
3. Set Requested_exception_status to 1 if you do want the resource to have an
 exception state. DUIFVCFT will set value XCPT in the ResourceTraits field for
 this resource.<br>

<b> enable_change_status</b>
 This parameter is used to prevent view change notifications (VCNs) when
 a field is set to its previous value.<br>
 The values for this parameter are:<br>
O Used if either the prev_val subfield does not exist on the field, or if
 a VCN must be issued even if the field is changed to its previous
 value.<br>
1 Used if the prev_val subfield exists on the field, and if a VCN
 must not be issued when the field is changed to its previous value.<br>
<b> rule</b>The criteria used to determine if a field change results in a VCN being
 issued. It is implicit in each of these rules, with the exception of<br>
ANY_FIELD_OBJECT_CHANGE, that the objectID or classID and fieldID
 involved in the change are used to construct at least one view that is
 currently open.<br>
 The values for this parameter are:<br>
1 OBJECT_CHANGE: Send a view update if the field changes at the
 object level.<br>
2 VALUE_INCREASE: Send a view update if the field changes at the
 object level and the value of the field increases.<br>
3 VALUE_DECREASE: Send a view update if the field changes at the
 object level and the value of the field decreases.<br>
4  CONNECTIVITY: This rule applies to the ObjectLink and
 ObjectLinkList data types. Send a view update if the field changes
 at the object level and the link or unlink results in a change to the
 connectivity displayed in the view. For the following view types,
 only one of the objects needs to be currently in a view to indicate a
 view change:<br>
Configuration Parents<br>
 Configuration Logical<br>
 Configuration Physical<br>
 Configuration Backbone<br>
 Configuration Child<br>
 Configuration Child II<br>
 Configuration Child III<br>
 For all other view types, both objects must be in a view to indicate
 a view change.<br>
5 CLASS_CHANGE: Send a view update if the field changes at the
 class level.<br>
6  OBJECT_OR_CLASS_CHANGE: Send a view update if the field
 changes at the object or class level.<br>
7 ANY_FIELD_OBJECT_CHANGE: Send a view update if the field
 changes at the object level whether or not the field was used to
 construct the view. This is for customers that want to monitor
 fields that are not involved in view building, including exception
 views. The other rules do not result in a VCN for exception views.
 See “Defining Exception View Objects and Criteria” on page 98 for
 more information.<br>

<h2>Appendix A. RODM Tools</h2>
 The NetView program provides the following tools for use with RODM:<br>
. RODMView is an interactive application program for viewing and updating the
 values of fields in the RODM data cache. See “RODMView.”<br>
 . FLCARODM (RODM Access Facility) provides a fast and efficient REXX
 interface to RODM. See “FLCARODM” on page 552.<br>
 . RODM Collection Manager enables the arbitrary grouping of objects into views
 or aggregates and dynamically manages the views or aggregates. See “RODM
 Collection Manager” on page 597.<br>
 . The BLDVIEWS tool is used for defining custom views that match your network
 layout and your preferred style of monitoring it. See “BLDVIEWS” on page 598<br>
 . DELVIEWS can be used for deleting certain customized views. See “DELVIEWS”
 on page 671.<br>
 Some panels in this section show GMFHS information.<br>
<h2> RODMView
</h2>
 Use the RODMView application program to view and update the values of fields
 in the RODM data cache. RODMView runs under an OST task in the NetView
 program. The following RODMView topics are covered:<br>
 . Navigating within RODMView<br>
 . RODMView restrictions<br>
 . Starting RODMView<br>
 . Using the RODMView fu<br>
<h2> Navigating within RODMView</h2>
 You can navigate within RODMView in the following ways:<br>
 v
.Using the main menu<br>
 . Using accelerator PF keys<br>
 . Using the PF keys displayed at the bottom of a pane<br>
 Panel data entry fields are identified by underscored lines, and a command line is
 at the bottom of each panel.<br><br>
<h2> Navigating Using Menus</h2>
 RODMView has a main menu panel, which is illustrated in Figure 92 on page 516.
 To navigate to the option that you want, enter the corresponding selection number,
 or select the appropriate line with the cursor and press Enter. If you enter an
 option that is not valid, an error message is displayed.<br><br>
 From any RODMView panel, you can navigate directly to the panel of another
 RODMView function by pressing an associated accelerator PF key. Accelerator PF
 keys PF13–PF22 correspond to option numbers 1–10 respectively, as shown in
 Table 219 on page 514.<br>
